                <p>Plato was born around 428 B.C. in Athens, Greece. He is considered one of the most influential philosophers in Western history. He was a student of Socrates and the teacher of Aristotle, he founded the Academy in Athens, one of the earliest known organized schools in the Western world. He died in 347 B.C., leaving behind philosophies preserved through written works that continue to influence every aspect of our modern life.</p>

                <p>Plato's influence varies widely based on how his written work affects many diffrent subject. My favorite of his contributions is the allegory of the cave where he explores the concept of knowledge itself. Another one of his influences was that of the theory of forms where he theorized an absolute form was the basis of all concepts essentially making everything an imperfect derivative.</p>
